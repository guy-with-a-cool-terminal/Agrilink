## Review System Logic

### Review Eligibility
- **Who Can Review Whom:**
  - Consumer → Farmer (for their products in completed orders)
  - Consumer → Retailer (if order came through retailer)
  - Consumer → Logistics (delivery provider)
  - Farmer → Consumer (who bought their products)
  - Retailer → Farmer (product suppliers)
  - Retailer → Consumer (bulk order customers)
  - Logistics → Everyone (in orders they delivered)
  - Everyone → Logistics (delivery service provider)

### Auto-Approval System
- Ratings ≥3 stars: Automatically approved
- Ratings ≤2 stars: Require admin review
- Transparent system: Reviewer names visible for accountability

### Order Requirements
- Only completed/delivered orders can be reviewed
- One review per user per order
- Both reviewer and reviewee must be involved in the order

## API Endpoints

### Public Review Endpoints
```
GET /api/reviews - List user's reviews (filtered by role)
POST /api/reviews - Submit new review
GET /api/reviews/{id} - Get specific review
GET /api/users/{userId}/reviews - Get reviews for specific user
GET /api/orders/{orderId}/reviewees - Get potential reviewees for order
```

### Admin Moderation Endpoints
```
PUT /api/reviews/{id} - Update review status/add admin notes
DELETE /api/reviews/{id} - Delete review
```

## Integration with Existing System

### Preserved Functionality
- All existing order, user, product, delivery functionality intact
- Existing authentication and role systems unchanged
- Current API response formats maintained
- Existing error handling patterns followed

### UI Integration
- Review buttons appear in order history tables for completed orders
- Modal-based review submission using existing styles
- Notification system integration for success/error messages
- Consistent styling with existing dashboard components

### Database Design
- Foreign key constraints maintain data integrity
- Indexes for performance on common queries
- Cascading deletes when orders/users are removed

## Usage Examples

### Submit Review (Consumer)
1. View order history in consumer dashboard
2. Click "Add Review" for completed orders
3. Select user to review from dropdown
4. Rate 1-5 stars and optionally add comment
5. Submit - auto-approved if ≥3 stars

### Admin Moderation
1. Access review management in admin dashboard
2. View pending/flagged reviews
3. Approve, reject, or flag reviews
4. Add admin notes for moderation decisions

### View User Reviews
1. User profiles show average rating and review list
2. Only approved reviews visible to non-admin users
3. Reviewers can see their own submitted reviews regardless of status

## Security & Validation

### Access Control
- Users can only review orders they're involved in
- Admin-only access to moderation functions
- Review visibility based on approval status and user roles

### Data Validation
- Rating must be 1-5 integer
- Comment limited to 1000 characters
- Order must exist and be completed
- Prevents duplicate reviews for same order/user combination

## Future Enhancements
